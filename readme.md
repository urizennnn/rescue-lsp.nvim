## Aim
Rescue-Lsp is a drop-in replacement for some features of the lspconfig plugin. As at the make of the readme the ```LspInfo``` command opens up a new tab and shows explicit data of ```lua 
:checkhealth``` in Neovim. The problem with this is that, there are too much unecessary data. So I wanna use this and create the same floating window just to bring that aesthetic back.

## Other ways
Alternatively you could just install the lspconfig version that had that but you might miss out on any improvements or breaking changes.


## Known bugs
- [ ] The text in the floating windows doesn't fit (yet).
